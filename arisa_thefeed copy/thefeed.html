                <p> My iPhone storage has been full for the last 2 years or so and I’m constantly having to delete apps & photos on the spot if I want my phone to continue collecting my data, kind of problematic when I want to take photos & whatnot.

                <p> I try to walk as many steps as possible throughout the day & throughout the week so that I feel more refreshed throughout the day, get better sleep, & keep my body in motion. Moving from Hawaii to SF, the proximity & walkability of various parts of the city have been super amazing to experience. </p>

                <p> I like to collect clothes and curate my closet through second hand clothing applications like Grailed, offering an infinite variety of designers, styles, and prices, which makes it very convenient for me to source & purchase a specific item.
